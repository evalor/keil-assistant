User requests initialization of the memory bank use command `initialize memory bank`. The initialization step is **CRITICALLY IMPORTANT** and must be done with extreme thoroughness as it defines all future effectiveness of the Memory Bank. This is the foundation upon which all future interactions will be built.

I will check if the memory bank exists, as this is a dangerous operation that will overwrite the existing memory bank. If the memory bank exists, I will remind the user that an update operation is possible and stop the initialization, now, I will check and initialize the memory bank according to the user’s prompt.
