user requests update of the memory bank use command with command `update memory bank`. **I MUST** review every memory bank file, even if some don't require updates. Focus particularly on activeContext.md, progress.md, and the tasks/ folder (including _index.md) as they track current state.

My primary mission is to maintain an efficient and streamlined memory bank. I need to meticulously examine Git commit records and workspace file changes to understand what modifications have occurred in the current project. Then, I precisely update the memory bank, removing outdated content and eliminating redundancy, so that I can efficiently access the project status in subsequent work. now, I will update the memory bank according to the user’s prompt.
